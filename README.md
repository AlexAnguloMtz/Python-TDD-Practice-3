# Description 
These are some Python exercises to practice 
Test Driven Development, Object Oriented Programming and Fuctional Programming

# How to run the tests:

1) Open the root folder of the project in your terminal
2) Run the following command: 
```
python3 -m unittest
```

After running the command, you will see the results for the tests in your terminal

# How to run the exercises:
1) Open the root folder of the project in your terminal
2) Run the standard Python command to run any of the exercises in the root folder. For example: 
```
python3 exercise_one.py
```

## Exercise One:
Write a program to read an initial and a final temperature
from the command line. The values will be Fahrenheit degrees.

Print a table showing the equivalences between the Fahrenheit 
degrees and Celsius degrees. 

You should show the results in order, starting with the initial value
and stopping at the final value, adding one Fahrenheit degree for each
row and the Celsius equivalent for each Fahrenheit temperature. 

## Exercise Two:
A phone enterprise has decided to 
increment their monthly rate by 4% each month.

Imagine that we are in January 2010 
and the initial rate starts at 57.00 USD.

Write a program to print the monthly
rate for January 2011, 2012, 2013, etc., up to 2035

## Exercise Three:
Write a program that can read from the command line 
an initial and final measurement in meters, and convert those
meters to yards, feet and inches.

You must print a table with all the equivalences, 
starting at the initial measurement, adding one meter
for each row, and stopping at the final measurement.

In each row you should print the equivalences between 
meters and all the units mentioned before.
